== Introduction

Student Buddy is a desktop application tailored for users who are comfortable with using a Command Line Interface (CLI), while retaining a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ease of use. The use of a CLI for user input allows users to manage their tasks more efficiently than when using a conventional user interface.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}blob/master/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}blob/master/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `CalendarPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TaskManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the user's data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Task Manager`, which `Task` can reference. This would allow `Task Manager` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task Manager data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::loginfunction[]
=== Login Feature

==== Current Implementation

* The login mechanism is facilitated by `TaskManager`, `SignupCommand`, `LoginCommand`, `LogoutCommand`, `DeleteAccountCommand`, `LoginEvent`, `GenerateHash`, `JsonLoginStorage`.

* The login feature is mainly supported by the `Command` class and `account` class. +
There are two types of accounts in login feature which are implemented in the `account` class: +
1. A normal user account +
2. An admin account. +
The username and hashed password are stored in a JSON file.

The class diagram below illustrates the `account` class.

image::AccountClassDiagram.png[width="200"]

* In `model` class, there are methods to check for +
`loginStatus` (if the user is logged in), +
`adminStatus` (if the admin is logged in), +
`userExists` (if the username is already taken), +
`accountExists` (if there is already an account created).

* In this feature, there are 4 main commands.
The flow on how the commands are executed and their respective sequence diagrams will be further elaborated below: +
1. Section 4.1.2, Signup Command +
2. <<Login Command>> +
3. <<Logout Command>> +
4. <<DeleteAcc Command>>

==== Signup Command

* Signup Command creates an account for the user and stores their username and password in a JSON file.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `signup`.

|===
|Step 1. The user signs up and keys in username and password using the command `signup u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`.
|Step 2. The `TaskManagerParser` recognises the command word as a signup from `SignupCommand` and calls `SignupCommand`.
|Step 3. `SignupCommandParser` will parse the arguments to `SignupCommand`.
 `SignupCommand` will call the following commands which are linked to `LoginEvent`.

`getLoginStatus` to check if the user is already logged in. +
`userExists` to check if there is already an account with the same username. +
`accountExists` to check if an account has already been created. +

If the arguments passes all the commands, `newUser(user)` will be called to store
the username and hashed password in a User class.
It will then pass the User object to `JsonLoginStorage`.
|Step 4. `JsonLoginStorage` retrieves the User object to read and write Json files with the correct Json properties.
|Step 5. It will then return to `loginEvent` then to `SignupCommand` and returns the user a successful signup output.
|===

The sequence diagram below shows the flow of `signup` from Step 1 to Step 5 above.

image::SignUpSequenceDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== Login Command

* Login Command logs in the account for the user by checking the username and password stored in the JSON file.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `login`.

|===
|Step 1. The user logs in by keying in username and password using the command `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`.
|Step 2. The `TaskManagerParser` recognises the command word as a login from `LoginCommand` and calls `LoginCommand`.
|Step 3. `LoginCommandParser` will parse the arguments to `LoginCommand`
 `LoginCommand` will call the following command which is linked to `LoginEvent`.

`getLoginStatus` to check if the user is already logged in. +

If the arguments passes `getLoginStatus`, `logUser(user)` will be called in `LoginEvent` to
check for username and password match.
|Step 4. In `LoginEvent`, `JsonLoginStorage` retrieves the username and hashed password from the Json file.
|Step 5. `loginEvent` will then check if the user inputs matches the username and password stored and
will then return to `LoginCommand` and returns the user a successful login output.
|===

The sequence diagram below shows the flow of `login` from Step to Step above.

image::LoginSequenceDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== Logout Command

* Logout Command logs the user out of their account.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `logout`.

|===
|Step 1. The user logs out by keying in the command `logout`.
|Step 2. The `TaskManagerParser` recognises the command word as a logout from `LogoutCommand` and calls `LogoutCommand`.
|Step 3. `LogoutCommand` will call the following command which is linked to `LoginEvent`.

`getLoginStatus` to check if the user is already logged out. +
`getAdminStatus` to check if the admin is already logged out. +

If the arguments passes `getLoginStatus` and `getAdminStatus`, `logout` will be called in `LoginEvent`.
|Step 4. In `LoginEvent`, `getLoginStatus` and `getAdminStatus` will be set to false and will then
return to `LoginCommand` to return the user a successful logout output.
|===

The sequence diagram below shows the flow of `logout` from Step to Step above.

image::LogoutSequenceDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== DeleteAcc Command

* DeleteAcc Command is only accessible to admins. DeleteAcc deletes the entire account.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `DeleteAcc`.

|===
|Step 1. The admin logs in by keying in username and password using the command `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`.
|Step 2. The admin keys in `DeleteAcc` to delete the account.
|Step 3. The `TaskManagerParser` recognises the command word as delete account
from `DeleteAccountCommand` and calls `DeleteAccountCommand`.
|Step 4. `DeleteAccountCommand` will call the following command which is linked to `LoginEvent`.

`getAdminStatus` to check if an admin is logged in. +

If the arguments passes `getAdminStatus`, `deleteAccount()` will be called in `LoginEvent`.
|Step 5. In `LoginEvent`, JsonLoginStorage's `deleteAccount()` will be called to delete the JSON file.
|Step 6. `LoginEvent` will then call `reinitialise()` to create the Json file
without any username and password stored in it. `reinitialise()` is assisted by `JsonLoginStorage` and `writeJson()`.
|Step 7. `LoginEvent` will return to `DeleteAccountCommand` and returns the user a successful login output.
|===

The sequence diagram below shows the flow of `deleteacc` from Step to Step above.

image::DeleteAccountSequenceDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `LoginEvent` and `JsonLoginStorage` works together

* ** Alternative 1 (current choice): ** `LoginEvent` and `JsonLoginStorage` are in separate classes.

** Pros: Follows OOP coding. The codes will look more organised and clean.
** Cons: Coders will have to look at both files to code or debug as both calls each other frequently.

* ** Alternative 2: ** `LoginEvent` and `JsonLoginStorage` are in the same class.

** Pros: Easy to read and debug, all codes are in one file and thus easier for other coders to modify.
** Cons: Does not follow OOP coding. The codes in the file will look messy.

==== Aspect: How `LoginEvent` fits into the code

* ** Alternative 1 (current choice): ** `LoginEvent` is implemented into the logic.

** Pros: The code will be efficient and effective. It will be neat and the flow will be well structured.
Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns is maintained in the code.
** Cons: Might be confusing as `LoginEvent` is used frequently.
Coders might need to fully understand how other classes work before looking at `LoginEvent`.

* ** Alternative 2: ** `LoginEvent` is implemented on its own.

** Pros: It would be easier for coders to visualise and debug. `LoginEvent` can still run the entire Taskmanager.
** Cons: There would be a lot of repeated and redundant codes.
Most of the functions in the `logic` component will be repeated.
This will violate Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns.

==== Aspect: How the securing of password is implemented

* ** Alternative 1 (current choice): ** Create my own hashing fuction to secure password

** Pros: Hashing is a one way function. With a proper hashing design, there is no way to reverse
the hashing process to reveal the original password.
** Cons: Need to code out my own hashing function. More logic and function have to be written.
The code will be mroe complex.

* ** Alternative 2: ** Use encryption library to secure password

** Pros: Do not need to code much. Most of the function are one line. Easy to implement.
** Cons: Encryption is a two-way function. Encrypted strings can be decrypted with a proper key.
The password will not be secure.

// end::loginfunction[]

// tag::notes[]
=== Add Notes Feature

This feature allow users to add notes regarding miscellaneous matters.

The class diagram below illustrates the *Notes* class.

image::NotesClassDiagram.png[width="450"]

==== Current Implementation

The add notes mechanism is facilitated by _AddNotesCommand_. A _Notes_ object is instantiated which contains of _Heading_, _Content_ and _Priority_.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add notes mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters in a note with its *associated parameters*. e.g `note h/popular c/buy pilot G-2 blue pens p/2`.

Step 2. The _LogicManager_ calls _ParseCommand_ with that input.

Step 3. The _TaskManagerParser_ is called and returns a _AddNotesCommand_ object to _Logic Manager_.

Step 4. The _LogicManager_ will call _execute_ method on the _AddNotesCommand_ object.

Step 5. _ModelManager_ is then called and will check if the note already exists.

Step 6. If note already exists, _DuplicateNotesException_ will be thrown. This will return a string message "This note already exists in the task manager".

Step 7. Else, _addNotes(notes)_ method is called and note is added.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the mechanism for adding notes function.

image::AddNotesSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Checking for *duplicate notes*

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Implement a method to check new notes entered. If a new note added is exactly the same as exisitng notes in the Student Buddy, it will be classified as duplicate note and cannot be added.
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: May neglect duplicate notes that mean the same because the check is for the *exact same heading and content*. The following 2 examples shown below will be identified as different notes due to an additional *s* in example 2 +
1. `h/popular c/buy ring file` +
2. `h/popular c/buy ring files`
* **Alternative 2:** Implement a method to check for similarity of notes. If similarity is *more than 90%*, note is classified as same note and cannot be added.
** Pros: Can reduce the amount of duplicate notes that are added.
** Cons: Difficult to implement and *cannot eliminate duplicate notes completely*.

Final decision: Alternative 1 was chosen due to the *significantly easier* implementation.

=== Delete Notes Feature

This feature allow users to delete notes that are no longer wanted.

==== Current Implementation

The Notes mechanism is facilitated by _DeleteNotesCommand_ from the _Logic_ component. Upon executing the _DeleteNotesCommand_, the unwanted note will be removed from the memory of the Student Buddy.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `deletenote` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user calls the _DeleteNotesCommand_ with the note’s displayed index. e.g `deletenote 1`.

Step 2. The _LogicManager_ calls _parseCommand_ with the user input.

Step 3. The _TaskManagerParser_ is called and it returns a _DeleteNotesCommand_ object to the _LogicManager_.

Step 4. The _LogicManager_ will call _execute()_ on the _DeleteNotesCommand_ object. If no note of the corresponding index is found, it would return a string of message `MESSAGE_INVALID_NOTES_DISPLAYED_INDEX`.

Step 5. The _Logic_ component then interacts with the `Model` component which then calls `TaskManager` component within it to execute `deleteNotes(target)` to remove the note.

Step 6. The command result would then return the message `MESSAGE_DELETE_NOTE_SUCCESS` in a string.

The following diagram illustrates how the `deletenote` operation works:

image::DeleteNotesSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Weighing *user experience* to *convenience* of users

* **Alternative 1:** Implement a method to *strike off* notes that are completed so that users can keep track of what notes they have added in as well as the ones they finished.
** Pros: Better user experience
** Cons: May cause incovenience as users have to delete away completed notes every few days so as to allow easier viewing of latest notes.
* **Alternative 2(current choice):** *Deleting* completed notes away.
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Pros: Easy for users to manage completed notes.
** Cons: No sense of achievement as users are unable to view the amount of work completed.

Final decision: Alternative 2 was chosen due to it being *more practical and convenient* to users so that users will continue to use it in the future.
// end::notes[]


// tag::sorttask[]
=== Sort Task List Feature

==== Current Implementation

The sorting mechanism is facilitated by `TaskManager`, `Model` and `SortTaskList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1. The user keys in `sort ATTRIBUTE`, the `SortCommandParser` will trim the command to get the attribute.

Step 2. If the attribute is valid, it will then create a new `SortCommand` and execute with the given attribute.

Step 3. `SortCommand` will then call `ModelManager#sortTask(toSortBy)`.

Step 4. It will then call `TaskManager#sortTask(attribute)`.
Then we convert the relevant attributes of the tasks in the Task List to string to compare using `string#compareTo()`.

Step 5. Then, we use `setTasks()` in `UniqueTaskList` to update the Task List.
After returning the sorted Task List, the Task Manager is then committed.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates how the sort mechanism functions. More specifically, sorting by module code.

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How sort executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Write a class separately for handling the sorting of the task list.
** Pros: Easy to read and debug, Follows OOP coding and thus easier for other coders to modify.
** Cons: Difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Write a method for each attribute in `TaskManager`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Does not follow OOP coding.

// end::sorttask[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar feature
==== Current Implementation

The Calendar extends the `Student Buddy` GUI with an easy to read interface for tracking task deadlines. It is composed of three classes, `CalendarPanel`, `CalendarCell` and `CalendarCellTask`. Furthermore, it uses the JavaFX files `CalendarPanel.fxml` and `CalendarCell.fxml` to format and structure the display.

`CalendarPanel` is the base class, which builds and fills the calendar grid.

`CalendarCell` represents an individual cell of the grid in `CalendarPanel`.

`CalendarCellTask` represents an individual task inside each `CalendarCell`.

`CalendarPanel.fxml` is a `ScrollPane` containing a `GridPane`. The `GridPane` acts as the calendar grid.

`CalendarCell.fxml` is a `VBox` containing a `Text`, and a `ScrollPane` containing another `VBox`. The `Text` is the date of a calendar cell, and the second `VBox` contains the list of tasks in a cell.

The following class diagram illustrates the relationships between `CalendarPanel`, `CalendarCell` and `CalendarCellTask`:

image::CalendarClassDiagram.png[width="1000"]

The following steps show how the Calendar is built on startup:

|===
|Step 1: The constructor of `CalendarPanel` is called, thereby creating a new instance of `CalendarPanel`.
|Step 2: `buildCalendarPane(taskList)` is called, which contains function calls to `buildGrid()`, `createHeaderCells()`, `writeMonthHeader()`, `writeDayHeaders()`, and `createCalendarCells(taskList)`.
|Step 3: `buildGrid()` populates the calendar grid with the correct number of rows and columns.
|Step 4: `createHeaderCells()` fills the first two rows of the calendar with the month header cell and day header cells.
|Step 5: `writeMonthHeader()` writes the current month of the user's system clock to the month header cell.
|Step 6: `writeDayHeaders()` writes the days of the week to the day header cells, using the enumeration HEADERS.
a|Step 7: `createCalendarCells(taskList)` fills in the remaining calendar cells with `CalendarCell` instances.

* Step 7.1: `CalendarCell` calls `setDate(date)` and `setMonth(month)` to set the date and month of the cell.
* Step 7.2: `getTasks(taskList)` is called, which uses the task list stored in the app to create a list of `CalendarCellTask` s applicable for the cell according to the date and month.
* Step 7.3: `addTasksToCell()` sorts the list of `CalendarCellTask` s according to their priority, then adds them to the cell.
* Step 7.4: `setAppearance()` sets the background and border of the cell.
|Step 8: Done.
|===

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process outlined above:

image::CalendarBuildSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

Whenever the task list is updated, the function `createCalendarCells(taskList)` is called, which replaces the `CalendarCell` and `CalendarCellTask` instances in the `CalendarPanel`.

If the selected task is changed, or the month to be displayed changes (see <<Month view change feature>>), the function `resetCalendar()` is called, which clears the calendar grid and resets the row and column constraints. Then `buildCalendarPane(taskList)` is called to rebuild the calendar.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the Calendar is built

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate the calendar panel, calendar cells and tasks into their own classes.
** Pros: Reduces complexity of CalendarPanel class, making it easier to understand how the calendar is built.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Separate every component of the Calendar into their own classes (e.g. into CalendarPane, CalendarGrid, HeaderCell, ContentCell, etc).
** Pros: Follows the principles of Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns strictly.
** Cons: Even more memory usage, may make the code difficult to read and understand for future maintainers if they are unused to code spanning several files.
* **Alternative 3:** Combine all Calendar related code into a single class.
** Pros: No need to navigate between different classes.
** Cons: The class will be very long and complex, making the code difficult for future maintainers to read, understand and change. Violates the principles of Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns.

* **Rationale for choice:**
** It is the middle ground between alternatives 2 and 3, and thus strikes a balance between readability, maintainability and following Object-Oriented Programming principles. While it does not strictly follow the principles of OOP, it is easy to read the code and understand the processes involved, and is maintainable. This is important, as it is likely that future maintainters will be new Computer Science student undergraduates.

===== Aspect: How the calendar is updated in real time

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replace the previous `CalendarCell` and `CalendarCellTask` instances with with new instances when the task list changes.
** Pros: Easy to read and to understand, simpler and easier to implement.
** Cons: Potential performance issues. If the list of tasks is very large, rebuilding the Calendar at every step may result in degraded performance manifested as a loss of responsiveness to user commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Have `CalendarCell` and `CalendarCellTask` instances automatically update as the task list changes.
** Pros: No need to rebuild the entire calendar when the task list changes, instead only updating the cells and tasks that are affected.
** Cons: Adds another layer of abstraction, which can cause difficulty in understanding how the Calendar works.

* **Rationale for choice:**
** The choice of alternative 1 was made due to time constraints and lack of proper understanding of how to implement alternative 2. Ideally, alternative 2 will be implemented by future maintainers.
// end::calendar[]

// tag::monthChange[]
=== Month view change feature
==== Current Implementation

The `month` command allows a user to change what month they are currently viewing on the calendar. This is facilitated using the `currMonth` parameter in `Model`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `month`.

|===
|Step 1. The user types in `month` with its associated parameter, an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive.
|Step 2. The `TaskManagerParser` recognises the command word and calls `MonthCommandParser`.
|Step 3. `MonthCommandParser` will parse the arguments and call `MonthCommand`.
|Step 4. `MonthCommand` will then return one the following results:

 `CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_MONTH)` if the requested month and the current month are the same.
 `CommandException(MESSAGE_INVALID_MONTH)` if the requested month is invalid, for example "aaa" or "0".

If the arguments pass all the checks, the `currMonth` parameter in `Model` will be changed, which will then cause the calendar to be updated.
|Step 5. `MonthCommand` will then return a success message to the user.
|===

The following diagram illustrates the operation of the `month` command.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Student Buddy depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all tasks in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindNameCommand.java[`FindNameCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/TaskManagerParser.java[`TaskManagerParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/TaskManagerParser.java[`TaskManagerParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from every task in the task manager, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from every task in the task manager.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/TaskManager.java[`TaskManager`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/TaskManager.java[`TaskManager`] and link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/Task.java[`Task`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/TaskManager.java[`TaskManager`] allows you to update a task, and link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/Task.java[`Task`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/TaskManager.java[`TaskManager`]. Loop through each task, and remove the `tag` from each task.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `TaskManager#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your task manager application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last task in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside task cards. For example, `ungraded` tags can be all in brown, and `graded` tags can be all in yellow.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/TaskCard.java[the `TaskCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `TaskCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/systemtests/TaskManagerSystemTest.java[`TaskManagerSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and TaskManagerSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the task manager is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of tasks when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of tasks whenever there are new changes to the task manager.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/systemtests/TaskManagerSystemTest.java[`TaskManagerSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of tasks status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the task manager to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the task manager after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the task manager storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupTaskManger(ReadOnlyTaskManager)`, so that the task manager can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/TaskManagerStorage.java[`TaskManagerStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonTaskManagerStorage.java[`JsonTaskManagerStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* As a software maintainer for `TaskManager`, after the former developer team has moved on, you are. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular task, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a task specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Need to contact John for further details.` +
Edits the remark for the first task to `Need to contact John for further details.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first task.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' as a command
Teach the application how to parse a `remark` command. The logic of `remark` will be added later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/TaskManagerParser.java[`TaskManagerParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add a `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add a new test method to link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/TaskManagerParserTest.java[`TaskManagerParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Need to contact John for further details.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/TaskManagerParser.java[`TaskManagerParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/TaskManagerParserTest.java[`TaskManagerParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remarks in `TaskCard`
Add a placeholder on all link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/TaskCard.java[`TaskCard`]s to display a remark for each task later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with placeholder text inside link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/resources/view/TaskListCard.fxml[`TaskListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/TaskCard.java[`TaskCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/TaskCardHandle.java[`TaskCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add a `Remark` class
Practice proper encapsulation when adding the remark in the link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/Task.java[`Task`] class. Instead of a `String`, follow the conventional class structure that the codebase uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to the model (you can copy from link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/Name.java[`Name`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add a test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Task` to support a `Remark` field
Implement `Remark` in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/Task.java[`Task`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/Task.java[`Task`].
. Assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the task will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete `data/StudentBuddy.json` so that the application will load the sample data when launched).

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to the `JsonAdaptedTask` class
Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedTask.java[`JsonAdaptedTask`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved when the application is exited.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidTaskManager.json`, `typicalTaskTaskManager.json`, `validTaskManager.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `TaskBuilder`
Add a helper method to link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TaskBuilder.java[`TaskBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/Task.java[`Task`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TaskBuilder.java[`TaskBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the `Task` that it is currently building.
. Try to use the method on any sample `Task` in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalTasks.java[`TypicalTasks`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `TaskCard`
Bind the remark label in link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/TaskCard.java[`TaskCard`] with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/TaskCard.java[`TaskCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Task` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysTask(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
Add in actual logic for the `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a task.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

==== Full Solution

See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/599[PR] for the step-by-step solution for a similar application.
