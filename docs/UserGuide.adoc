== Introduction

Task Manager is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks*. More importantly, Task Manager is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Do you want to organise and prioritise your tasks and never miss a single deadline again? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : shows a list of all tasks in the Task Manager
* **`add`**`add CG2027 Assignment d/12.02.19 t/urgent` : adds a task named `CG2027` to the Task Manager.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
