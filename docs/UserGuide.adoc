== Introduction

Student Buddy is for tech-savvy students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks*.
More importantly, Student Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a keyboard rather than a mouse*, but still has a *graphical display* for easy viewing.
Do you want to organise, prioritise and never miss a deadline again? Then this app is perfect for you!

== Quick Start
Here are the steps to get you started with the Student Buddy.

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `TaskManager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Student Buddy.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. It should look like this:
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Try the following example commands to get a feel for the app:


* *`list`* : shows a list of all tasks in the app
* *`add n/Assignment m/CG2027 d/12-02 p/1`* : adds a task named `Assignment` of module `CG2023`, with submission date `12-02` and priority level `1` to Student Buddy.
* *`delete`*`1` : deletes the 1st task shown in the current list
* *`help`* : displays this guide inside the app
* *`exit`* : exits the app
