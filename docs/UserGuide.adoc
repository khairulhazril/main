== Introduction

Student Buddy is for tech-savvy students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks*.
More importantly, Student Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a keyboard rather than a mouse*, but still has a *graphical display* for easy viewing.
Do you want to organise, prioritise and never miss a deadline again? Then this app is perfect for you!

[TIP]
Student Buddy works best with a screen resolution of at least 1280x800.

== Quick Start
Here are the steps to get you started with the Student Buddy.

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `TaskManager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Student Buddy.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. It should look like this:

* *`help`* : displays this guide inside the app
