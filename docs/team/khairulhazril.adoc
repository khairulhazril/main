== PROJECT: Task Manager

---

== Overview
This portfolio serves to document my contributions in a team-based software engineering project for the module CS2113T.
The team comprises of 4 members ad we were tasked to develop a working application within 8 weeks.
We decided to morph the existing application into a task manager, called *Student Buddy*.

To comply with the module requirements, the team is constrained to start from an existing code base â€“ https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Addressbook Level 4] and the user must interact with the application via Command Line interface(CLI).

*Student Buddy* is a desktop application created for students to assist them in managing their schedule.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to *Student Buddy*.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to `sort` tasks*
** What it does: It allows the user to sort the tasks in the task list based on name, module code, date due or priority level.
** Justification: This feature improves significantly because it allows the user to organise the task list in a manner of their choosing.
** Highlights: It required an in-depth analysis and understanding on how the different components of the task manager is involved with each other.

* *Minor enhancement*: created a `daysLeft` function to find number of days remaining till the task is due and gave colour codes depending on how much days are left.

* *Minor enhancement*: created `findname`, `findmodule`, `finddate` and `findpriority` commands to be able to search not only by task name but by other variables.

* *Code contributed*: https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/dashboard-beta/#search=Khairul[Reposense]
